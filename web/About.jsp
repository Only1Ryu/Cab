                        Flash Cab was one of the first companies to launch metered "Radio cabs" in India under its brand "Flash Cab."
                        </br></br></br></br>

First launched in Mumbai in April 2007, Flash Cab Cabs has grown exponentially terms of fleet size and geographical presence. </br></br></br></br></br>Customers benefit from a relaxed commute in a well equipped, air-conditioned cab, which is readily available 24/7. An e-bill receipt at the end of the ride assures the customer of tamper proof billing.</br></br></br></br></br>

Headquartered in Mumbai, Flash Cab Cab provides a radio taxi service in seven key cities of India - Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad,
</br></br></br></br></br>Bengaluru, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Chennai Vadodara, Surat, Pune & Kolkata. Meru Cabs delivers a reliable taxi service by concentrating on each touch point with its customers and devising systems, processes or technologies that will deliver a reliable interface. Flash Cab Cabs uses GPS/GPRS enabled technology in all of the cabs to ensure complete passenger safety.</br></br></br></br></br>

The name "Flash Cab" is derived from the symbolic mountain of the gods, an icon of unshakeable reliability and character - a core value which lies at the heart of Meru's promise to its customers.
